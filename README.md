# Online Test Taking System
A web app for online test taking and grading. The app is live [here](https://web.njit.edu/~jrp68/CS490/Login.html).

***

Students can log in and take exams consisting of programming problems in Python, similar to coding practice sites like HackerRank or CodingBat. Their answers are autograded and appropriate feedback is given to each student which can then be viewed after the exam has been closed.

Instructors can also log in and create questions and exams as well as add their own feedback to the students' responses.

I supplied the backend code for this project.
